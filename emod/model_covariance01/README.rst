This example demonstrates the impact of heterogeneity on epidemic attack rate.
These simulations sweep over R0 with fixed levels for variance in an
individual's acquisition risk, transmission rate, and covariance between
acquisition risk and transmission rate.

Each simulation uses a single node of fully susceptible individuals and an
outbreak is initialized by a constant importation pressure of infected
individuals. There is no age structure, vital dynamics, or waning.
